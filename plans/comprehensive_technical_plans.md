# Frontend Router MCP: Comprehensive Technical Plans

## Executive Summary

This repository implements a **bidirectional communication bridge** between AI agents and human users through a sophisticated MCP (Model Control Protocol) service. The core innovation is enabling agents to initiate real-time conversations with users via web frontends, creating a seamless human-AI interaction paradigm.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**1. MCP Server (`cmd/server/main.go:72-90`)**
- Implements standard MCP protocol using `mark3labs/mcp-go`
- Exposes `ask_user` tool for agent-to-user communication
- Handles request-response lifecycles with timeout management
- Provides graceful shutdown capabilities

**2. WebSocket Server (`internal/wsserver/server.go:28-50`)**
- Manages real-time client connections via WebSocket protocol
- Implements client registration/deregistration with connection pooling
- Broadcasts messages to all connected clients
- Handles ping/pong for connection health monitoring

**3. Bridge Logic (`cmd/server/main.go:190-323`)**
- Orchestrates communication between MCP and WebSocket servers
- Manages request tracking and response routing
- Handles concurrent client connections and message broadcasting
- Implements error handling for disconnected clients

**4. AskUser Tool (`internal/tools/ask_user.go:13-44`)**
- Core tool implementation with timeout and error handling
- Thread-safe request management using channels and mutexes
- Unique request ID generation for message correlation
- Configurable timeout support (default: 300 seconds)

## Communication Flow Architecture

### Message Flow Pattern
```
AI Agent → MCP Server → Bridge → WebSocket Server → Frontend Client
                                                       ↓
AI Agent ← MCP Server ← Bridge ← WebSocket Server ← User Response
```

### Protocol Implementation

**1. MCP Protocol Integration**
- Standard MCP tool registration and execution
- JSON-RPC style request/response handling
- Parameter validation and error propagation
- Context-aware timeout management

**2. WebSocket Protocol**
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Message type routing (`connect`, `ask_user`, `user_response`)
- Connection lifecycle management
- Automatic reconnection handling

**3. Message Correlation**
- Unique request IDs for tracking conversations
- Pending request management with cleanup
- Response routing to correct tool instances
- Timeout handling with graceful degradation
