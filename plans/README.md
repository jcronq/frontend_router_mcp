# Frontend Router MCP - Technical Plans

This directory contains comprehensive technical plans for the Frontend Router MCP project, focusing on the guiding principle of creating an MCP service that enables agents to initiate communication with users via a frontend.

## Overview

The Frontend Router MCP is an innovative bidirectional communication bridge that allows AI agents to seamlessly interact with human users through web frontends. This system revolutionizes human-AI interaction by enabling agents to ask questions, request input, and receive responses in real-time.

## Core Architecture

```
AI Agent → MCP Server → Bridge → WebSocket Server → Frontend Client
                                                       ↓
AI Agent ← MCP Server ← Bridge ← WebSocket Server ← User Response
```
